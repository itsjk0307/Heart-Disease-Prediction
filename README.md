"# Heart-Disease-Prediction" 
Heart Disease Prediction Project
Description:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. We utilized a dataset containing various health parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. After data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, we implemented different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The model with the best performance was selected based on accuracy, precision, and recall.
Key Tools/Technologies:

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Outcome:
The model was able to accurately predict heart disease with an accuracy of X% (fill in your result), and this project showcases the importance of health data in building predictive models for early detection.
